# Pitapat Campus: Sprint #5 Backlog

## Implementation

### Frontend

Search filtering user interface corresponding to backend API was implemented in this sprint. Profile edit page is added, so users can modify their personal information, tags, self-introduction, and photos now. In addition, there were lots of feature enhancements: user blocking, infinite scroll in user list page, tag/image delete button, and so on.

### Backend

Block API was added; it represents a relation between two users, so block system works similarly to pitapat system. Email verification code became more complex to prevent malicious prediction.

## Deployment

The website has deployed via AWS EC2. Users can access to the service through Nginx web server. It communicates with uWSGI HTTP API server and ASGI chatting server.

Testing server is running now(https://pitapatcampus-test.com), and we will deploy production server until the poster session.

## Test Coverage

### Frontend

It was hard to write Search page test code. The page includes infinite scroll using `IntersectionObserver`, which is hard to mock.
